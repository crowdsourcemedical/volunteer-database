Thanks for helping out! 

We just got started so everything is still a bit messy

Need to learn this stack? Check out the django-rest-api documentation and perhaps follow the tutorial

We're working with a virtual env for now. To get started run the command: 'source env/bin/activate'

In the backend folder you can then run python manage.py runserver

check out the todo file to see what we need to get done
