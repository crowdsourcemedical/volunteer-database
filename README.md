# This is the official CSM (Crowd source medical) database

![Django CI](https://github.com/crowdsourcemedical/volunteer-database/workflows/Django%20CI/badge.svg)

We created this in light of the covid-19 pandemic to allow  volunteers to work together in tackling the shortage of  ventilator equipment.

Backend is a django rest api with a postgres database, Frontend is react

We're just getting started so documentation is lacking

## Backend setup

This will clone the project, set up a virtual Python environment, and install the dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/StanTheMan132/CrowdSourceMedical
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
